# Puzzle8 AI Techniques
This project uses some AI techniques to solve an 8 piece puzzle within a 3x3 grid.

## REQUIREMENTS
(1) Your code is free of compilation error or runtime errors (10%)
(2) For the iterative deepening search, your code can iteratively increase depth limit and
perform DFS correctly (10%)
(3) Successfully return an optimal path by iterative deepening search (10%)
(4) Correctly define Heuristic function h() for A-star search (10%)
(5) Correctly compute the total cost f(S) = g(S) + h(S) for each move (10%)
(6) A-star search correctly expand states in the right order (15%)
(7) A-star search correctly get an optimal path (25%)
(8) Provide a short document describing what you have achieved and limits, with some
snapshots (10%)
